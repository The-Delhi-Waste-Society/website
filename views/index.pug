								| Waste segregation refers to the separation of general, recyclable and compostable waste.It is extremely important for proper waste disposal and consequently, the well being of the environment and its inhabitants.
								br
								br
								| We have already implemented this system in our School and aim at spreading this system to other schools, not only in Delhi but all over India. We strive for a Zero-Waste Society and hope to expand our area of work and impact.

						p
							| In a world at the precipice of a global climate crisis, each and every one of us must do what we can to avert this eminent threat. Every effort towards this goal, simple or large, will have an essential impact on our society.
							br
							br
							| With this goal in our mind, we set off to create the Dustbin Bois. After carrying out this project in our school, we wanted to create a platform where other students can learn from our model, and implement their own version of it in their homes, societies and schools to create a cleaner environment.
							br
							br
							| We have also created this platform for students to share their thoughts and ideas on how we can work towards implementing more sustainable practices in our society, and spread awareness on the need for it as well.
							br
							br
							| So join us in working towards creating cleaner, healthier and sustainable practices!
